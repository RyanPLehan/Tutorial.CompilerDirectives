1.  Directives are used by Visual Studio and its compiler to assist the developer with the following
	a.	Warnings while compiling the code
	b.	Conditional compiling - compiling specific sections of code
	c.	Defining/Undefining symbols
		1.	If manually defining a symbol in a file, definition must be at the top of the file and every file where the symbol is to be used
	d.	Defining constant values
		Note: This is applicable to C and C++, not C# and VB.net
	e.	Defining regions - Allows code to be collapsed/expanded
		Note: This is applicable to C and C++, not C# and VB.net
	e.	Creating macros
		Note: This is applicable to C and C++, not C# and VB.net
	f.	Generate user defined compiler errors and warnings
	g.	Pragmas - gives the compiler special instructions for compilation of the current file of which the Pragma appears

2.	Visual Studio compiler does not have a pre-processor.  However, the directives act as if it has a pre-processor

3.	Depending upon the compiler, directive keywords can be case sensitive
